# atom-time-recorder
A super simple javascript time recorder utility for the Atom editor. (actually
    it's a port of my Notepad++ python script which does the same thing.)



If I ever find the time, or want more functionality, I may update this in future.
However, at the moment it suits my needs just fine so it may well stay this way
forever.



-- This was a really quick & dirty exercise so the code is not good. --
